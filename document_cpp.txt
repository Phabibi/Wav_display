Enviroment to use : Mac OS
Compilations: 
               executbales are already provided just run : brew install wxwidgets --HEAD && ./q2
  
               if you need to re build the exetubales: make clean &&  make all && ./q

               additionally you  need to install the following UI library using brew. 

              `brew install wxwidgets --HEAD` if you dont already have wxWidgets


Code structure: 
      wav.h 
           Header:
               - the class for the wav file format 

          - Wav:
               - is responsible for reading and parsing the Header and Data
               - wav::Reader() parses the header -> reads the data -> closes the file 
        
       base.h and Main.cpp:
           - responsible for the UI aspects and contains the main frame
           - Open will open a new file exploarer that only lets you open Wav formatted files.
           - Quit will quit. 


      canvas.h and Canvas.cpp:
          - responsible for displaying the wav files 
          - has a Wav member variable for the wav data. 
          - draws the wav files on the screen 


Calla stack: 

     - Open file (base.h -> open EVT is triggered thus openfile() function that will A) open up th file browser B) gives you options to only open wav fils) -> *after openining desired file
                 -> Canvas.cpp(Draw() function is called to set the layout of the canvas and get it ready for rendering) -> render() ( willl start drawing the data by constructing the Wav class using the given path) ->
                    wav.h ( Reader()  will start reading the wav file , seperates the header and logs info to console, populates the data object) -> fade in and fade out will start after the data object has been retrieved prope                    I made the graph to be 2000x300, thus half the width = 1000 , half the height = 150 inorder to draw the 0 -> + and bottom half - -> 0 ;
     - Quit ( Main.cpp will just triger the quit() event that will quit the window, note it wont quit the canvas, you must close canvasases individually)  
Features: 
         you can have multiple Wav files open. after opening 1, simply just press open again to have multiple open at the same time 
         It will display the file you openend and also the number of samples in that wav file 
         displays the wav in a different frame than the orignal hence multiple can be open at the same time 
         the butotns are resizable, when you change the size of the window it wil shrink/expand 
         the file opener is programmed to only allow .wav files to open and nothing else
