               - the class for the wav file format 

          - Wav:
               - is responsible for reading and parsing the Header and Data
               - wav::Reader() parses the header -> reads the data -> closes the file 
        
       base.h and Main.cpp:
           - responsible for the UI aspects and contains the main frame
           - Open will open a new file exploarer that only lets you open Wav formatted files.
           - Quit will quit. 


      canvas.h and Canvas.cpp:
          - responsible for displaying the wav files 
          - has a Wav member variable for the wav data. 
          - draws the wav files on the screen 
      
Features: 
         you can have multiple Wav files open. after opening 1, simply just press open again to have multiple open at the same time 
         It will display the file you openend and also the number of samples in that wav file 
         displays the wav in a different frame than the orignal hence multiple can be open at the same time 
         the butotns are resizable, when you change the size of the window it wil shrink/expand 
         the file opener is programmed to only allow .wav files to open and nothing else
